## DreamFactory MCP Service

> **Note:** This repository contains the mcp service features of the DreamFactory platform. If you want the full DreamFactory platform, visit the main [DreamFactory repository](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/dreamfactory).

## Overview

DreamFactory is a secure, self-hosted enterprise data access platform that provides governed API access to any data source, connecting enterprise applications and on-prem LLMs with role-based access and identity passthrough.

## Installation

Edit your project’s composer.json to require the following package.

	“require”:{
		"dreamfactory/df-mcp-server": "~0.1.0"
	}

Save your composer.json and do a "composer update" to install the package.

### MCP Daemon process
The Laravel package proxies every MCP request through a persistent Node.js daemon that keeps long-lived MCP server instances warm.

1. Install dependencies
   ```
   cd daemon
   npm install
   ```
2. Configure the daemon host/port (or use defaults) and point DreamFactory to it by adding the following to your `.env` file:
   ```
   MCP_DAEMON_ENABLED=true
   MCP_DAEMON_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8006
   ```
3. Start the daemon (choose the mode you need):
   ```
   # Development
   npm run dev

   # Production
   npm start
   ```

Once the daemon is online, the MCP routes in DreamFactory automatically forward traffic to it.

### Authentication

The MCP service uses OAuth-based authentication. Users must authenticate with DreamFactory via OAuth to obtain a session token. The Laravel controller validates requests and passes the session token to the daemon via the `X-DreamFactory-Session-Token` header.

See `daemon/README.md` for advanced options, available tools, and management endpoints.
